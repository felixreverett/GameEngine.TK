# GameEngine.TK

## What is this project?
- This is my instance of a video-lead code workshop from [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL65gBgyEEQ9l04ueCI_DLgZW-4hbYHi0H) excellent YouTube tutorial series.

## Why am I doing this?
- Learning to code through graphics libraries is still learning to code (I am developing transferable skills).
- I want to learn OpenGL4 from as contemporary of a source as possible.
- I started with the OpenTK.net/learn series, but want something with more modern practices.
- If I can get a game framework running, this opens the doors to countless coding opportunities.
